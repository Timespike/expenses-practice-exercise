Form needs to validate that the input is correct
add a date field?
items need a delete button

add field for deposits? radio button, perhaps?

Items from expense list should be objects with a name and a value
Objects should be stored in an array
List should be populated from the array
    if date field is added, order expenses by date
total should be calculated from the values in the array
    if deposits and expenses are both used, deposits should be in a separate column and green; expenses should be red

every time the list is added to or deleted from, it should automatically refresh and recalculate
